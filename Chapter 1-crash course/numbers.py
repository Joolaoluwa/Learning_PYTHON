#integers
# I made an observation when dividing two integers in python,
# The division gave a floating point variable, but in other languages like C++,
# the floating point is truncated
# number1 = 10
# number2 = 4
# multiply = number1 * number2 # multiplication operation
# addition = number1 + number2 # addition ooperation
# divide = number1 / number2 # division operation
# square = number1 ** number2 # square operation
# multiple_op = multiply + addition
# print(multiply, "\n", addition, "\n", divide, "\n", multiple_op, "\n", square)

#Floating point
#Any number preceded by a point is known as a floating point number
fn1 = 42.54  # fn1 for floating point 1
fn2 = 32.54  # fn2 for floating point 2
multiply = fn1 * fn2 # multiplication operation
addition = fn1 + fn2 # addition ooperation
divide = fn1 / fn2 # division operation
print(multiply, "\n", addition, "\n", divide, "\n")
